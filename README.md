# MI-BSS-GL: Joint Graph Learning and Blind Separation of Smooth Graph Signals
This repository implements a demo for **Joint Graph Learning and Blind Separation of Smooth Graph Signals Using Minimization of Mutual Information and Laplacian Quadratic Forms** using the proposed **MI-BSS-GL** method, similar to the Figures 1 and 2 in our paper [1]. In the case of finding its contents useful for your research work, kindly please cite our paper [1] addressed below. Thanks a lot for your attention.

IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks 9 (2023): 35-47.](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSIPN.2023.3240893)

The codes were written in MATLAB 2018b, and the [GSPBOX](https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/) and [UNLocBoX](https://epfl-lts2.github.io/unlocbox-html/) toolboxes are also needed to run this demo.

- Run `Demo_MI_BSS_GL.m` to generate the desired results. 

Note that we have used an accelarted graph learning method for learning the underlying graph proposed in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3123459). Besides, in the comparisons, we used an implementation of the JADE method released [here](http://www2.iap.fr/users/cardoso/code/Jade/jadeR.m).
